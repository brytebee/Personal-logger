# Week of 7th
A log of the week that started 7th and ended 11th July 2025
## Summary of what you worked on
I tried to level up this week with the ALX ProDev Backend

I had about 3 weeks back log and wanted to meet up fast so I used AI profussly.

However, I managed to level-up and completed the task for the previous weeks and now I can focuss on learning the concepts properly with better plans and resources.

## Your Achievements
I completed tasks that covered
- Setting up a database: SQL Database using MySQL
- SQL advance queries
- Python Generators
- Context managers and async programming with python
- Python Decorators
- Setting up a Django project
- Setting up a production-level database using the Airbnb clone

## Learnings from failures or challenges
Some of the challlenges faced:
- Internet data purchase
- Power challenge due to Solar system battery degrade
- Inability to study the concepts deeply due to the points above
- Since I was late to resume the course, I had little onboarding experience
  - Auto-checker not working
  - Didn't know how peer review worked.

## Monthly highlights
Claude AI to the rescue as it facilitate my quick level up with proper prompting. I also give credits to Elvis Enya and Oladipupo Ishola who were instrumental resource persons who helped me.
